Fosbury provides a platform and SDK to integrate iBeacons in your
application easy and seamlessly. After the implementation, you will be able
to manage your beacons and set up experiences that are triggered when
beacons are in range, such as push notifications, triggering in-app webviews
<https://beacons.fosbury.co/docs/experiences#experience-types> and  webhooks
<https://beacons.fosbury.co/docs/advanced#webhooks>
